# DBot - Discord Bot for Stock Predictions

This project is an extension of the [stockpred](#) project and involves the creation of a Discord bot that allows users to interact with stock predictions, visualize trends, and retrieve pricing data with ease.

## Features

- **Stock Predictions**: Retrieve stock predictions using various algorithms implemented in the `pred.py` and `pred2.py` files.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Visualize stock data and predictions with the help of built-in graph functions (`graphs.py`).
- **Price Retrieval**: Fetch and display historical stock prices using `prices.py`.
- **Example Data**: The `dbexamp/` directory contains various example datasets such as air passengers, retail sales, and more to test and visualize predictions.
